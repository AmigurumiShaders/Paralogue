Paralogue is a simple dialogue plugin developed in Unreal Engine 5.4, designed specifically to help achieve to the narrative goals of our game, Channel Getaway. 
This tool is still in early development, and thus many of the core features are not yet implemented. They are also subject to change as we learn more about our needs and Unreal Engine itself.
That being said, the current core feature goals include:
- **Simplified persistent variable management** - Use persistent game instance variables within the dialogue editor, to allow characters to "remember" and react to past player actions at any time
- **Flexible and out-of-the-way** - If you find that this tool doesn't accommodate your needs out-of-the box, it should allow you to build what you do need through the existing Unreal systems - no need to "break" anything
